          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            At ZHAcademie, our mission is to empower international students to achieve their academic dreams by
            providing expert guidance through the complex process of U.S. university admissions and visa applications.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            We believe that education transcends borders, and every qualified student deserves the opportunity to access
            world-class education in the United States. Through personalized support, cultural understanding, and
            technical expertise, we bridge the gap between international students and U.S. institutions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Our commitment extends beyond just securing admissionsâ€”we prepare students for academic and cultural
            success, fostering global citizens who will make meaningful contributions to society.
